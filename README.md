# Introduction 

Welcome to the public repository for Carillon Community Survey 2021. There are 3 files of interest: `Lam-Tersigni-Survey-Questions.pdf`, `Lam-Tersigni-Summary-of-Survey-Responses.pdf`, and `Lam-Tersigni-Consent-Form.pdf`. The first is a PDF of the Surveymonkey form that the survey was run on, the second is the summary of results, and the last is the consent form for interviews.

If you are interested in the underlying, individual-level survey data, please contact msll [at] umich [dot] edu and elisa.tersigni [at] gmail [dot] com with a project description and why the data would be necessary to your project. Oral interview data will not be available. Programming code is also requestable (note that it will be in Stata).
