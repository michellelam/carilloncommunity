# Introduction 

Welcome to the public repository for Carillon Community Survey 2021. There are two files of interest: `Lam-Tersigni-Survey-Questions.pdf` and `Lam-Tersigni-Summary-of-Survey-Responses.pdf`. The first is a PDF of the Surveymonkey form that the survey was run on, and the second is the summary of results. 

If you are interested in the underlying, individual-level survey data, please contact msll [at] umich [dot] edu and elisa.tersigni [at] gmail [dot] com with a project description and why the data would be necessary to your project. Oral interview data will not be available.
